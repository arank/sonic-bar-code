Whisper Project For HackMIT Spring 2013
==============

The code for the django and python backend of the ultra sound website encoder developed by me, Andrew Maubossin and Sergui Balanovich for HackMIT Spring 2013. This code allows a user to encode a url as a unique high freqency (undetectable by humans) "sonic bar code". This code when recorded on a device like an iphone and posted (in part) back to the site will be analyzed and return the correpsonding url.

This is mainly a proof of concept.
